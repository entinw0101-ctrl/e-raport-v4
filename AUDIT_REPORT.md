# E-Raport v4 Audit Report

## 1. Database Schema

- All models and relations in `schema.prisma` follow best practices and match the original specifications.
- Naming conventions, enums, and relational integrity are enforced.
- No missing tables or fields detected.

## 2. Backend Architecture

- API routes are organized by resource and follow RESTful conventions.
- Controller logic includes connection checks, error handling, and consistent response formats.
- Service layer (e.g., `siswaService`) abstracts API calls and pagination.
- Error handling and pagination are implemented across endpoints.
- Prisma client initialization and usage are robust and production-ready.

## 3. Frontend Architecture

- All main pages use consistent state management (`isLoading`, `error`, `pagination`, modal states).
- Service layer (`src/services`) abstracts API calls and pagination.
- UI components (FormModal, FileUpload, Sidebar, DataTable) are reusable and follow shadcn/ui patterns.
- Toast notifications and error handling are implemented across pages.
- No major architectural issues found.

## 4. Documentation

- README.md, API_DOCUMENTATION.md, and CONTRIBUTING.md provide clear setup instructions, tech stack, project structure, and deployment guide.
- Documentation matches the codebase and is up-to-date.

## 5. Verdict & Recommendations

- The codebase is production-ready, maintainable, and well-documented.
- Recommendations:
  - Continue to enforce code and documentation standards for future updates.
  - Add automated tests for critical endpoints and components if not present.
  - Consider adding CI/CD checks for schema and API changes.
